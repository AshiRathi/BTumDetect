# BTumDetect
The objective of the project was to determine the presence of brain tumor in input images using ResNet, Inception V3, VGG16, DenseNet121 algorithms and compare the efficiency of the algorithms in accurately determining the presence of brain tumor in a set of testing images from Kaggle dataset. The algorithms were successively compared to evaluate the effectiveness on the desired dataset.
